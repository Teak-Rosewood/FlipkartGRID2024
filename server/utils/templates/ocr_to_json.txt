1. If the `productname`, `price`, `mfg_date` or `net_weight` is not present, set it to `"NA"`.
2. If `shelf_life` is not provided, set it to `"NA"`.
3. If `price` or `shelf_life` are `"NA"`, predict them from the text or trustable sources and add them to `estimates`.
4. Ensure that `price` is a number (float), `mfg_date` is a date and `shelf_life` is an integer in days.
5. Include all additional details under the `metadata` field.
6. Note that all these products are sold in India.
